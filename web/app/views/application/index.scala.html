        <i>Employability</i> is a research project exploring how universities are preparing students for the workforce.
        Its name comes from the notion of how <i>employable</i> a student is upon graduation.
    </p>

    <h3>How to use</h3>

    <p>
        This site is designed to report the results of the project. Use the navigation bar on the left to jump around
        sections of the website, exploring the inferred topics and related documents. The <em>Topics</em> portal allows
        you to browse all of the inferred topics. Similarly, the <em>Documents</em> portal allows you to browse
        a random selection of the modeled documents. Elements in each portal are hyperlinked to one another.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, if you click on a topic, you will be brought to that topic's page, along with a selection of documents
        that express that topic at a high relevance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Similarly, if you click on a document, you will be brought to that document's page, along with all the topics
        it expresses and their relevance values.
    </p>

    <h3>What is a topic?</h3>

    <p>
        In the context of this project, a <em>topic</em> is a statistical distribution over a vocabulary. Take the
        following topic, for example.
    </p>

    @components.topic(mockTopic, link = false)

    <p>
        In this contrived topic, the most frequent terms are "cat" and "dog", with "pig" occurring at a lower frequency
        and irrelevant words like "robot" occurring almost never. Since this topic would have been automatically
        inferred in an unsupervised fashion, there's no label for it. But, using human intuition, one might expect this
        topic to be related to documents about family pets.
    </p>

    <h3>What is a document?</h3>

    <p>
        A document is a collection of words written (presumably) by a human. Those words contain themes that the author
        intended to convey in their writing. These themes can be modeled as term frequency distributions (topics).
    </p>

    <p>
        In the context of this project, a <em>document</em> is either a Job Description or a Course Description. The
        contents of the document are modeled according to inferred topics.
