        This is a comprehensive handbook exploring pathways to improving overall
        career and college readiness in American students. After the completion
        of secondary education, most students have the choice to pursue a career
        immediately or enter an institution of post-secondary education. A
        student's success in either of these subsequent endeavors is heavily
        predicted by their readiness not only to enter the space, but to decide
        which path to take. The student's education is the best opportunity to
        improve this readiness.

        A great deal of factors in a student's education play into this readiness.
        The CCRS Organizer defines four high level categories each broken down
        into further educational components. Of these many components, ``Academic
        Content'' --- the domain knowledge a student must acquire to succeed in a
        post-secondary field --- is only one.

        Motivates the idea that universities are being viewed as primarily
        preparing students for the workforce. That is, universities should
        be maximizing the 'employability' of their students. Discusses the
        notion of an Employability Performance Indicator (EPI) and its
        merits and consequences. Ultimately, any measure of an EPI should
        not be used for comparisons or 'league tables' to compare institutions,
        as so many factors that cannot be considered within a single EPI would
        be lost by the wayside (including institutional variance, employer
        variance, economic and policy factors, etc). Any EPI should primarily
        be directed to help improve institutions and used internally.

        Employability-development is the idea that institutions help students
        develop their employability --- that is, the things an institution can
        do to help maximize the preparedness of a student for the workforce.

        Ultimately any EPI must be clearly defined in what it measures.
        Many indicators run the risk of at best not clearly measuring anything
        of value, or at worst misleading students, educators, and employers.

        Defining employability is extremely difficult. Starting with outcome-based
        definitions (i.e., whether or not the student actually got a job) can be
        tricky:

          ... pragmatic measures prioritise job acquisition as it is easier to
          measure but, in so doing, measure the effectiveness of the institution
          rather than the employability of the graduate.

        Definitions of terms are also critical. Even words like 'graduate' can
        be misconstrued. Any measure of employability must take into account
        areas for improvement. External and comparative measures of instutitions
        (frequently resulting in tables / comparisons / benchmarks / etc) can
        be harmful if definitions are unclear, if the metrics are not self-aware
        and transparent.

        Additionally, what an employer is looking for (e.g. in a job description)
        does not necessarily correlate with a measure of succses in that job.
        Employers are assumed to act 'rationally', but there may be evidence to
        the contrary.

        The topic modeling technique employed is the entirely unsupervised
        statistical method Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). LDA allows a user
        to rapidly identify topics from bags of words. These topics are
        actually frequency distributions over the total vocabulary of the corpus.
        Using the topics extracted from the course descriptions, secondary
        analyses include computing percent topic overlap in prerequisite chains,
        comparison of topic space at various universities, and comparison against
        topics mined from ABET, an accrediting organization used as a source of
