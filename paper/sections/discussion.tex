\section{Discussion}

Perhaps the most striking result is that only four topics of five hundred total can be considered strictly overlapping.
An additional eighteen topics (for a total of twenty two) can be considered weakly overlapping for the same threshold of 1\%.
There are several ways to interpret this.

The most direct reading of the data indicates, simply, that universities are not teaching to what the workforce expects.
Of the five hundred extracted topics, some are expressed by curricular data, some are expressed by career data, but the degree of overlap is low.
The Jaccard index of the two sets is only 0.044, indicating a significant dissimilarity.

However, perhaps the most probable interpretation is that the number of extracted topics was simply significantly too low.
Considering that almost fifty thousand documents were modeled across the two corpora, and considering that any given document can express many different topics, five hundred topics is simplty too low a number.
Increasing that count to several hundred thousand would most likely garner significantly higher levels of overlap.
The LDA process is storage and memory bound.
Increasing the number of topics significantly beyond five hundred would require significant computational resources.
This is a future goal for this work.
