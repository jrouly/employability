\section{Related Work}

Previous work has supported the application of LDA to corpora of postsecondary course descriptions and online job postings in order to automatically identify the domain skills discussed in each.
Poch et.\ al.\ apply LDA to job descriptions and candidate profiles in order to compute similarity between the two and rank the job offers for each candidate.~\cite{poch2014}
Their methodology includes first mining latent topics from the corpus.
De Mauro et.\ al.\ similarly apply LDA to online job postings to mine latent topics, which they then categorize into a structured classification of jobs within the targeted space (so called ``Big Data'' jobs)~\cite{de2018}.
Rouly et.\ al.\ use LDA to mine latent topics from a corpus of online course descriptions and uses the results to compare the curricular composition of various institutions~\cite{rouly2015}.
This work proposes combining these two approaches to synthesize a measure of \textit{employability}, specifically the domain skills component thereof.
